# Data_Visualization_Bicycle_Data_PHL
Data Visualization of cycling in Philadelphia and pollution

This work was created as a final project for a data visualization class. I am hoping to improve and add on to visually showing my home town Philadelphia benefitting from additional protected bike lanes and Indego stations.

This project has been created before D3.js has been moved to Observable. This was made at the time where D3.js was available to run on one's local envrionment. Attempts to download and work with the project may prove difficult. I plan on updating this project.

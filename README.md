# Data_Visualization_Bicycle_Data_PHL
Data Visualization of cycling in Philadelphia and pollution

This work was created as a final project for a data visualization class. I am hoping to improve and add on to visually showing my home town Philadelphia benefitting from additional protected bike lanes and Indego stations.
